# Linux Journey 📘

This repository documents my learning and hands-on practice with Linux.
This repo might look a little empty right now, but I’m working on it every day.
I love learning in public and I’m excited to fill this up as I go.☺️

## What I'm Doing

- Reading Linux books
- Practicing commands
- Working through RangeForce modules

## Structure

- RangeForce-notes/
- The Linux Command Line: A Complete Introduction/

More folders will be added as I go.

## Goals

- Build confidence using Linux
- Understand the command line deeply
- Document everything I learn

## Status
