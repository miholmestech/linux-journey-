# Module: CLI Introduction

> **Platform:** RangeForce – Linux Core Path  
> **Date:** 12-01-2025

---

## Objective
Understand what a Command Line Interface (CLI) is, how it differs from a GUI, and how to use the terminal to navigate the Linux filesystem.

---

## Summary
A CLI allows users to interact with the computer using only the keyboard and commands. Unlike a graphical interface that relies on a mouse, the terminal provides powerful tools to accomplish tasks directly through text input. This module introduced the shell prompt and explained the role of commands.

---

## Tasks Completed
- Logged into a shell session  
- Identified the shell prompt  
- Ran basic commands to navigate the system  
- Viewed current working directory  
- Listed files and directories  

---

## Commands Used
```bash
ls
pwd
cd
cd ..
/var
```

---

## Directory Structure (FHS)
The **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)** defines how Linux organizes files and directories. Key locations include:

- `/` – root of the filesystem  
- `/home` – user home directories  
- `/etc` – system configuration files  
- `/var` – variable data like logs  
- `/usr` – user tools and applications  

---

## Key Takeaways
- The terminal is efficient and powerful  
- Commands are small programs that perform tasks  
- You can navigate the system using keyboard only  
- `pwd` shows where you are, `ls` shows what's there  
- The shell prompt tells you when the system is ready  

---

## Reflection
This module helped me get comfortable using the terminal and navigating the filesystem without relying on a graphical interface. It set a solid foundation for the rest of the Linux Core path.
